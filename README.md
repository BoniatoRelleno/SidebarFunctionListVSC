# Sidebar Function List

The Sidebar Function List extension adds an interactive list of functions to the right sidebar of Visual Studio Code, inspired by the functionality of Notepad++. 

This tool is ideal for developers working on projects with large files or long functions, as it allows for quick and efficient code navigation. 

## How to use

You only need to use the 'Show Function List' command at Command Palette.

Then you can see the function list at right sidebar. If you click one element you will navigate to the function declaration line!

## Supported languages

At the moment, it works with all languages that use the 'function' keyword for function declaration, such as JavaScript or PHP.
